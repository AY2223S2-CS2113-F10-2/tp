## Design & implementation
### Store and Display Notes
The Store and Display Notes functionality allows users to input notes 
which will be stored in a list, and to display a list of all notes
stored by users. This functionality is achieved through the `Store.` and `List.` commands.

The syntax for the commands of this functionality is as follows:
1. `Store. <item>` For storing of notes into the list, where `<item>` represents the note that 
users would like to store. 

   Example: `Store. addition`
2. `List.` For displaying of a list of all notes stored by users.

   Example: `List.`

Below is an illustration of how the `Store.` and `List.` are used to allow
users to input notes to a list and to display a list of all notes that are
stored inside the list.
1. This is step 1.
2. This is step 2.
