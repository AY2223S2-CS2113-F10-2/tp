## Introduction üßÆ

Hello! Welcome to BadMaths! BadMaths is a quick lookup tool for 
trigonometry graphs and basic matrix operations that aims to help students save
time when performing Mathematical Operations. 

To help you get started, our team has put together this user guide to guide you on
the steps to operate BadMaths for your Mathematical woes.

## Quick Start

{Give steps to get started quickly}

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
1. Down the latest version of `Duke` from [here](http://link.to/duke).

## Features 

### 1) Graph analyser and visualiser: `Graph. `
This feature accepts a trigonometry equation (Sinusoidal signal) and outputs the amplitude, frequency, phase, and vertical shift.
It also displays the image of the corresponding graph.

Format: `Graph. [Amplitude]*[Trigo]([Frequency]*x+[PhaseShift])+[VerticalShift]`

* `[Amplitude]` can be any positive number.
* `[Trigo]` can be sin, cos or tan.
* `[Frequency],[PhaseShift],[VerticalShift]` can be any number.
* `[]` is not needed when entering the input.

Example input:
```
Graph. 2*sin(5*x+2)-8
```

### 2) Matrix calculation: `Matrix. `
 This feature accepts matrix equation and outputs calculation result.

 Format: `Matrix. [Matrix] [operator] [Matrix]`

 * `[Matrix]` is the 2 dimensional matrix with integer elements. When you declare the matrix, you should follow the matrix format below:
   ```
   [1,2;3,4]
   ```
   * You should separate the elements with comma (,) in the single row.
   * You should separate the rows with the semicolons.

   ```
   [1,2;3,4].T
   ```
   * You can declare transposed matrix with the transpose annotation `.T`.
   * Transposed matrix above is equal with matrix `[1,3;2,4]`.

 * `[operator]` is the matrix operator. You can use 4 operators below:
   * `.*` : matrix multiplication
   * `*` : element wise product
   * `+` : matrix addition
   * `-` : matrix subtraction

 Example input:
 ```
 Matrix. [1,2;3,4] .* [4,5;6,7]
 ```

Example of usage: `Mark. 1`

### 8) Unmark a specific note:
Unmark a particular note stored in the Notes list as incomplete

Format: `Unmark. <number>`
Example of usage: `Unmark. 2`

### 9) List all completed notes:
Display a list of all completed notes

Format: `FindMark.`
Example of usage: `FindMark.`

### 10) List all uncompleted notes:

Format: `FindInfo. <description>`
Example of usage: `FindInfo. index`

### 12) Display all notes based on priority type:
Find all notes stored in the list based on its respective priority rankings

Format: `Rank. Priority`
Example of usage: `Rank. Priority`

### 13) Display all notes of a certain priority type:
Find all notes stored in the list based on priority that users are searching for

Format: `FindPrior. <Priority Type>`
Example of usage: `FindPrior. <LOW>`
Example of usage: `FindPrior. <MEDIUM>`
Example of usage: `FindPrior. <HIGH>`

### 14) Clear all notes stored in Notes List:
Delete all notes stored in the list

Format: `Clear.`
Example of usage: `Clear.`

### 15) Exit MathHelp:
Exit and leave MathHelp:

Format: `Bye.`
Example of usage: `Bye.`
