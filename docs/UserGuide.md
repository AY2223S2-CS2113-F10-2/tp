## Introduction üßÆ

Hello! Welcome to BadMaths! BadMaths is an integrated study tool that performs Mathematical Operations and contains
various features for note-taking.

To help you get started, our team has put together this user guide to guide you on
the steps to operate BadMaths for your study woes.

## Quick Start

Before you start using BadMaths, make sure you have the following ready!

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `BadMaths` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-2/tp.git).

## Features

### 1) Graph Analyser and Visualiser: `Graph`
This feature accepts a trigonometry equation (Sinusoidal signal) and outputs the amplitude, frequency, phase, and vertical shift.
It also displays the image of the corresponding graph. 

Format: `Graph [Amplitude]*[Trigo]([Frequency]*x[sign][PhaseShift])[sign][VerticalShift]`

* `Amplitude` can be any positive number. E.g. `15.5`, `4`, `0`
* `Trigo` can be sin, cos or tan. 
* `Frequency` can be any positive integer (more than 0). E.g. `100`
  * When entering frequency, one can include ùúã by typing `2*pi*x` instead of `6.283*x`
* `PhaseShift`, `VerticalShift` can be any positive number. E.g. `15.1`, `4`, `0`,`1`
* `sign` can be + or - .
* `[` and `]` are not needed when entering the input.
* Some form of elimination is possible: 
  * When `Amplitude` is 1, `1*cos(1*x)` can be shortened to `cos(1*x)`
  * When `PhaseShift` or `verticalShift` is 0, `[sign][PhaseShift]` or `[sign][VerticalShift]` are not needed.

**Note: Accuracy of graph drawn is up to 4 digits (Thousand place) for numerical inputs. E.g. `9999`.**


Example input 1:
```
Graph 2985*sin(5999*x+2665)-8678
```
Example output 1:
```
This is the amplitude: 2985.0
This is the freq (Hz): 954.7705036082801
This is the phase: 2665.0
This is the vertical shift: -8678.0
```

Example input 2:
```
Graph 2*sin(5*pi*x-2)+5.6
```
Example output 2:
```
This is the amplitude: 2.0
This is the freq (Hz): 2.5
This is the phase: -2.0
This is the vertical shift: 5.6
```
![img_5.png](img_5.png)

Example input 3: 
```
Graph cos(5*x)
```
Example output 3:
```
This is the amplitude: 1.0
This is the freq (Hz): 0.7957747154594768
This is the phase: 0.0
This is the vertical shift: 0.0
```

### 2) Matrix Calculation: `Matrix`
This feature accepts matrix equation and outputs calculation result.

Format: `Matrix. [Matrix] [operator] [Matrix]`

* `[Matrix]` is the 2 dimensional matrix with integer elements. When you declare the matrix, you should follow the matrix format below:
  ```
  [1,2;3,4]
  ```
   * You should separate the elements with comma (,) in the single row.
   * You should separate the rows with the semicolons.

  ```
  [1,2;3,4].T
  ```
   * You can declare transposed matrix with the transpose annotation `.T`.
   * Transposed matrix above is equal with matrix `[1,3;2,4]`.

* `[operator]` is the matrix operator. You can use 4 operators below:
   * `.*` : matrix multiplication
   * `*` : element wise product
   * `+` : matrix addition
   * `-` : matrix subtraction

Example input:
 ```
 Matrix. [1,2;3,4] .* [4,5;6,7]
 ```
### 3) Store Notes: `Store`
