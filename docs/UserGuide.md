## Introduction üßÆ

Hello! Welcome to BadMaths! BadMaths is a quick lookup tool for 
trigonometry graphs and basic matrix operations that aims to help students save
time when performing Mathematical Operations. 

To help you get started, our team has put together this user guide to guide you on
the steps to operate BadMaths for your Mathematical woes.

## Quick Start

{Give steps to get started quickly}

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
1. Down the latest version of `Duke` from [here](http://link.to/duke).

## Features 

### 1) Graph analyser and visualiser: `Graph. `
This feature accepts a trigonometry equation (Sinusoidal signal) and outputs the amplitude, frequency, phase, and vertical shift.
It also displays the image of the corresponding graph.

Format: `Graph. [Amplitude]*[Trigo]([Frequency]*x+[PhaseShift])+[VerticalShift]`

* `[Amplitude]` can be any positive number.
* `[Trigo]` can be sin, cos or tan.
* `[Frequency],[PhaseShift],[VerticalShift]` can be any number.
* `[]` is not needed when entering the input.

Example input:
```
Graph. 2*sin(5*x+2)-8
```
