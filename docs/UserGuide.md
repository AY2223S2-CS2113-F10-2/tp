# GitHub User Guide for MathHelp ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó

## Introduction üßÆ

Hello! Welcome to MathHelp! MathHelp is a quick lookup tool for 
trigonometry graphs and basic matrix operations that aims to help students save
time when performing Mathematical Operations. 

To help you get started, our team has put together this user guide to guide you on
the steps to operate MathHelp for your Mathematical woes.

## Quick Start

{Give steps to get started quickly}

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
1. Down the latest version of `Duke` from [here](http://link.to/duke).

## Features 

### 1) Graph analyser and visualiser: `Graph. `
This feature accepts a trigonometry equation (Sinusoidal signal) and outputs the amplitude, frequency, phase, and vertical shift.
It also displays the image of the corresponding graph.

Format: `Graph. [Amplitude]*[Trigo]([Frequency]*x+[PhaseShift])+[VerticalShift]`

* `[Amplitude]` can be any positive number.
* `[Trigo]` can be sin, cos or tan.
* `[Frequency],[PhaseShift],[VerticalShift]` can be any number.
* `[]` is not needed when entering the input.

Example input:
```
Graph. 2*sin(5*x+2)-8
```

### 2) Matrix calculation: `Matrix. `
 This feature accepts matrix equation and outputs calculation result.

 Format: `Matrix. [Matrix] [operator] [Matrix]`

 * `[Matrix]` is the 2 dimensional matrix with integer elements. When you declare the matrix, you should follow the matrix format below:
   ```
   [1,2;3,4]
   ```
   * You should separate the elements with comma (,) in the single row.
   * You should separate the rows with the semicolons.

   ```
   [1,2;3,4].T
   ```
   * You can declare transposed matrix with the transpose annotation `.T`.
   * Transposed matrix above is equal with matrix `[1,3;2,4]`.

 * `[operator]` is the matrix operator. You can use 4 operators below:
   * `.*` : matrix multiplication
   * `*` : element wise product
   * `+` : matrix addition
   * `-` : matrix subtraction

 Example input:
 ```
 Matrix. [1,2;3,4] .* [4,5;6,7]
 ```
