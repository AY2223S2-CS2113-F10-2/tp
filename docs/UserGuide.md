## Introduction üßÆ

Hello! Welcome to BadMaths! BadMaths is a quick lookup tool for
trigonometry graphs and basic matrix operations that aims to help students save
time when performing Mathematical Operations.

To help you get started, our team has put together this user guide to guide you on
the steps to operate BadMaths for your Mathematical woes.

## Quick Start

Before you start using BadMaths, make sure you have the following ready!

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `BadMaths` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-2/tp.git).

## Features

### 1) Graph Analyser and Visualiser: `Graph`
This feature accepts a trigonometry equation (Sinusoidal signal) and outputs the amplitude, frequency, phase, and vertical shift.
It also displays the image of the corresponding graph. 

Format: `Graph [Amplitude]*[Trigo]([sign][Frequency]*x[sign][PhaseShift])[sign][VerticalShift]`

* `[Amplitude]` can be any positive number. E.g. `15.5`, `4`, `0`
* `[Trigo]` can be sin, cos or tan. 
* `[Frequency]` can be any positive integer (more than 0). E.g. `100`
  * When entering frequency, one can include ùúã by typing `2*pi*x` instead of `6.283*x`
* `[PhaseShift],[VerticalShift]` can be any number. E.g. `15.1`, `4`, `0`,`-1`
* `[sign]` can be + or - .
* `[` and `]` are not needed when entering the input.

**Note: Accuracy of graph drawn is up to 4 digits (Thousand place) for numerical inputs. E.g. `9999`.**

Example input:
```
Graph 2985*sin(5999*x+2665)-8678
```
```
Graph 2*sin(5*pi*x-2)+5.6
```

### 2) Matrix Calculation: `Matrix`
This feature accepts matrix equation and outputs calculation result.

Format: `Matrix. [Matrix] [operator] [Matrix]`

* `[Matrix]` is the 2 dimensional matrix with integer elements. When you declare the matrix, you should follow the matrix format below:
  ```
  [1,2;3,4]
  ```
   * You should separate the elements with comma (,) in the single row.
   * You should separate the rows with the semicolons.

  ```
  [1,2;3,4].T
  ```
   * You can declare transposed matrix with the transpose annotation `.T`.
   * Transposed matrix above is equal with matrix `[1,3;2,4]`.

* `[operator]` is the matrix operator. You can use 4 operators below:
   * `.*` : matrix multiplication
   * `*` : element wise product
   * `+` : matrix addition
   * `-` : matrix subtraction

Example input:
 ```
 Matrix. [1,2;3,4] .* [4,5;6,7]
 ```
### 3) Store Notes: `Store`
* Adds a new item to the Notes list.
* Format: `Store <item description>`

Example input:
```
Store isNote
```
Expected output:
```
You have added this note: 
isNote
Now you have <number> of notes in the list
```

### 4) Display All Notes: `List`
* Display a list of all items stored by user.
* Format: `List`

Example input:
```
List
```
Expected output:
```
Here are the notes you have stored:
1. [LOW][N][0]note_item_1
2. [LOW][N][0]note_item_2
3. [LOW][N][0]note_item_3
```

### 5) Display A Specific Note: `List <index>`
* Display a particular item in the Notes list through index of list item.
* Format: `List <index of list item>`

Example input:
```
List 2
```

2. [LOW][N][0]note_item_2
```

### 6) Delete Notes: `Delete <index>`
* Delete a particular item stored in the Notes list through index of list item.
* Format: `Delete. <index of list item>`

Example input:
```
Delete 2
```
Expected output:
```
You have removed this note:
[LOW][N][0]note_item_2
Now you have <number> notes in the list.
```

### 7) Clear All Notes Stored In Notes List `Clear`
* Delete all note items stored in Notes List.
* Format: `Clear.`

Example input:
```
Clear
```
Expected output:
```
File content cleared successfully!
```
### 8) Mark Notes: `Mark`
* Mark a particular item in Notes List as completed.
* The mark bracket will change from `[N]` to `[Y]`.
* Format: `Mark <number>`

Example input:
```
Mark 2
```
Expected output:
```
You have marked this note as done:
[LOW][Y][0]note_item_2
```
### 9) Unmark Notes: `Unmark`
* Unmark a particular item in Notes List as incomplete.
* The mark bracket will change from `[Y]` to `[N]`.

* Format: `Unmark <number>`

Example input:
```
Unmark 2
```
Expected output:
```
You have unmarked this note:
[LOW][N][0]note_item_2
```
### 10) List All Items Marked As Completed: `FindMark`

  numbers are acceptable (eg. `-2.5x^2 + 3 + 1`). Inputting just the sign is also acceptable (eg. `-x^2 + x - 1`).

Examples:

- Input: `Quadratic. 2x^2 + 2x + 1` Output: `x is imaginary.`
- Input: `Quadratic. x^2 + 4x - 5` Output: `x1 = 1.0 , x2 = -5.0`
